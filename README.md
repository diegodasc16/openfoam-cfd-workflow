# Automated CFD Workflow for Cylindrical Geometries

This repository provides an automated workflow for conducting external flow simulations around cylindrical geometries using [OpenFOAM](https://openfoam.org/). The project streamlines the simulation processâ€”from geometry creation to meshing, case setup, and executionâ€”through a fully scripted Python/Bash pipeline.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Customizable cylinder sizes
- Automatic generation of 3D cylindrical geometries via `Blender`
- Mesh creation via `snappyHexMesh`
- Customizable simulation parameters
- Semi-automated
- Modular and extensible structure for future developments
